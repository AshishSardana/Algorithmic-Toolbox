### Solutions: Algorithmic Toolbox

This repository contains the solutions to the programming assignments that I coded while taking this MOOC.

The purpose of this repository is to help the coders out there who're stuck with the Coursera's evaluator - that accepts only a predefined template of code and also for the people who're beginners in this field.

> All the codes may not be optimized.
